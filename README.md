# OpenVoice Integration and Scripts

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and configurations for deploying **OpenVoice**, a versatile instant voice cloning approach. OpenVoice allows users to replicate a speaker's voice from just a short audio clip and generate speech in multiple languages. It enables granular control over various voice characteristics, including emotion, accent, rhythm, pauses, and intonation. This implementation also supports zero-shot cross-lingual voice cloning, making it a powerful tool for diverse applications.
